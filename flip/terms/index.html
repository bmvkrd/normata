  <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
  <p>Last updated: April 30, 2025</p>

  <p>Welcome to <strong>Flip</strong>, a mobile application developed and maintained by an individual developer under the name <strong>Normata</strong> (“we,” “us,” or “our”). These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) govern your use of the Flip app (“App”). By using the App, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree with these Terms, please do not use the App.</p>

  <h2>1. Use of the App</h2>
  <p>Flip is a flashcard app that helps users learn and memorize content through quizzes and interactive study tools. Users can create Study Sets (collections of cards), which are stored locally on their devices. These Study Sets are not shared publicly or with other users.</p>

  <h2>2. Subscriptions and Premium Features</h2>
  <p>The App offers a premium plan, <strong>Flip PRO</strong>, which unlocks additional features such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Card Groups: Organize large Study Sets into smaller, manageable groups.</li>
    <li>Cards Importer: Import multiple cards at once using CSV format.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These features are accessible via a paid subscription. All purchases are processed via <strong>RevenueCat</strong> and governed by the respective app store’s policies.</p>

  <h2>3. User Data and Privacy</h2>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect any personal information. The App operates without requiring users to create accounts or log in. However, we use third-party services including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Firebase</strong>: For hosting and managing downloadable Study Sets available within the App.</li>
    <li><strong>RevenueCat</strong>: For managing in-app purchases and subscription billing.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>All content and materials in the App, including logos, text, and features, are the property of the developer operating under the name Normata, or its licensors. You may not copy, reproduce, or redistribute any part of the App without express permission.</p>

  <h2>5. Limitations of Liability</h2>
  <p>Flip is provided on an "as is" basis. We do not warrant that the App will be error-free or uninterrupted. To the extent permitted by law, Normata shall not be liable for any damages arising from your use or inability to use the App.</p>

  <h2>6. Modifications to Terms</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the App after changes are made constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms. We recommend checking this page periodically for updates.</p>
